# CNN_Gesture-master-
The first CNN project I attempted during my university years marked my first step into deep learning. It originated from GitHub and sparked my interest in this field. I have always kept it stored on my notebook, but eventually decided to upload it to my own repository. Everyone is welcome to download it and offer valuable suggestions. I sincerely thank those who provide their precious advice.
